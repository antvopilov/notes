### macOS terminal

If you are using macOS, you should consider using [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) instead of the default terminal (Terminal.app). The iTerm2 terminal has much better mouse support as well as better handling of key events. For best keybinding behavior, choose `xterm defaults` under `Preferences->Profiles->Keys->Presets...`, and select `Esc+` for `Left Option Key` in the same menu. The newest versions also support true color.

If you still insist on using the default Mac terminal, be sure to set `Use Option key as Meta key` under `Preferences->Profiles->Keyboard` to use option as alt.
