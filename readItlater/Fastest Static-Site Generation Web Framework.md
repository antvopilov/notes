# [Fastest Static-Site Generation Web Framework](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

Generate it statically. Generate it dynamically. Or, somewhere in between. However you build your website – **build it fast, secure, and scalable with Gatsby 4.**

## Build anything **you can imagine**

Gatsby gives frontend teams the tools and technology they need to build world-class web experiences. From marketing sites, to eCommerce stores, to documentation. Gatsby can help you build it.

## The hardest parts of the web, made simple.

Performance. SEO. Security. Integrations. Accessibility. We’ve got it covered for you. Gatsby makes the hardest parts of building an amazing digital experience simple, leaving you more time focusing on your business.

### **Performance** that's off the charts

Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources, and more to ensure your site is fully optimized. **No manual tuning required.**

### **Scalability** you can count on

Gatsby sites don’t require complex scaling operations or expensive hosting. They scale when needed, but when traffic drops so does your usage — and your costs. **Host at scale for pennies.**

### **Security** out of the box

Gatsby’s serverless rendering generates static HTML at build time. No server and no reachable database equals no malicious requests, DDOS attacks, or accidental exposure. **A Gatsby site’s attack surface is nonexistent.**

### **Accessibility** for everyone

Recognized by WebAIM as the most accessible web framework, we build in best practices like accessible routing, progressive page enhancement and a built-in linting tool to find accessibility errors. **Help make the web work for everyone.**

    > We needed our site to be blazing fast, scalable, have top notch SEO and, most importantly, **allow content creators who are not developers to easily publish new pages**. Gatsby did not disappoint: Six months after implementing Gatsby we have increased our organic blog traffic by 973% - and expect that number to keep increasing!

    > Traffic spiked immediately when our Super Bowl ad aired and we just didn’t have to worry … Because we built with Gatsby, we knew we had the performance to handle the traffic without even thinking about it.

    > With Gatsby we immediately saw a 2x boost in site performance with a 10x increase in page load speeds. As a result, we’ve definitely seen a decrease in the bounce rate and an increase in our conversion rate.

#### Fast to run

## Gatsby is unbelievably fast & smooth. **Everything just feels...there.**

Gatsby loads only **critical** 1 parts of the page, exactly when the visitor needs it, and not a second sooner. Once loaded, Gatsby **prefetches resources** 2 for other pages so that clicking on the site feels buttery smooth and responsive. Everything is statically generated at runtime - so your site loads as fast as possible.
